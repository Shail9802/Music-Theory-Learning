Its pattern of whole and half steps is: W-W-W-H-W-W-H (W = whole step, H = half step). The Lydian mode is often used in jazz and rock music to create a dreamy and ethereal atmosphere.

                                      The <strong>Locrian mode</strong> is the seventh and last mode of the major scale, and has a very unstable and unresolved sound. It is characterized by its flattened second and fifth scale degrees, which give it a dissonant and diminished quality. Its pattern of whole and half steps is: H-W-W-H-W-W-W (W = whole step, H = half step). The Locrian mode is rarely used in traditional Western music due to its unstable tonality, but is occasionally employed in jazz and experimental music.
